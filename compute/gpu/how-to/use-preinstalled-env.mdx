Once you've [launched](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker) one of our ready-made [Docker images](/compute/gpu/reference-content/docker-images) on your Scaleway GPU Instance, you have access to a pre-installed Python environment. A number of useful AI core packages and tools are installed, including scipy, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter, tensorflow and the Scaleway SDK. Depending on the Docker image you choose, other packages and tools will also be pre-installed, providing a convenient framework environment for you so that you can begin work immediately.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have created a [GPU Instance](/compute/gpu/how-to/create-manage-gpu-instance)
- You have [generated your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have [launched a Scaleway AI Docker image on your GPU Instance](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker)

</Message>

<Message type="note">

The preinstalled environment is no longer managed with Anaconda, as with prior versions of Scaleway's GPU Instances

</Message>

## Accessing the pre-installed environment

Ensure you have [connected to your GPU Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance) and then [launched a Scaleway Docker container](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker). 

You are now in the `ai` directory of the Docker container. Your command prompt should be similar to `root@11a1f374ecd7:/ai#`

Your pre-installed python environment is available for you here, in the `ai` directory.

## Managing packages

You can view packages, install/uninstall packages and update packages with a few simple commands:

1. Enter the following command to see all the packages and dependencies installed in this environment, and their versions:

  `pip list`

2. Enter the following command to install a new package:

  `pip install <package>`

3. Enter the following command to uninstall a package:

  `pip uninstall <package>`

4. Enter the following command to update a package:

  `pip install --upgrade <package>`

    <Message type="tip">

    To avoid losing any changes to your environment (or the data stored within it) upon exiting the container, you can [map the ai directoryto one of your GPU Instance's local volumes when launching the container](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker#how-to-map-volumes)

    </Message>

## Launching an application in your local browser

Some applications, such as [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) or [Code Server](https://code-server.dev/), require a browser to run. You can launch these from the `ai` environment of your Docker container, and view them in the browser of your local machine. This is thanks to the port mapping we specified when we ran the Docker container (the `-p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006` arguments of the `docker run` command).

1. Launch an application. Here, we launch Jupyter Lab:

  `jupyter-lab`

  Within the output, you should see something similar to the following:

  ```
  Activating14:34:30.288 ServerApp] http://df88da66d38d:8888/lab?token=...
  [I 2021-10-15 14:34:30.288 ServerApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...
  [I 2021-10-15 14:34:30.288 ServerApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
  ```

2. On your local computer, open a browser window and enter the following URL. Replace `<ip-address>` with the IP address of your Scaleway GPU Instance, and `<my-token>` with the token shown displayed in the last lines of terminal output after theh `jupyter-lab` command

  ```
  <ip-address>:8888/lab?token=<my-token>
  ```

  <Message type="tip">

  You can find the IP address of your Instance in the Scaleway console. In the side menu, click **Instances** to see a list of your Instances. The IP address of each of them is shown in the list that displays.

  </Message>

  Jupyter Lab now displays in your browser. You can use the Notebook, Console, or other features as required:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-jupyter-lab.png" alt="" />

3. Use CTRL+C in the terminal window of your GPU Instance / Docker container to close down the Jupyter server when you've finished.

<Message type="note">

To launch Visual Studio Code, you can access the required password with the command `cat ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml | grep password`

</Message>


## Exiting the pre-installed environment and the container


1. Type the following command to leave the pre-installed `ai` environment:

    ```
    cd ..
    ``

    You are now in the home directory of the container, outside the pre-installed environment.

2. Type the following command to exit the Docker container:

  `exit`

  Your prompt should now look similar to the following. You are still connected to your GPU Instance, but you have left the Docker container:

  `root@scw-name-of-instance:~#`
