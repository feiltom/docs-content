Scaleway GPU Instances are virtual compute instances equipped with dedicated high-end Nvidia graphical processing unit (GPUs). They are ideal for data processing, artificial intelligence, rendering and video encoding. After you have created your GPU Instance, you can [connect to it via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance) and run one of our ready-made [Docker images](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker) to access a [preinstalled environment](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-preisntalled-env) environment with all your [favorite AI libraries and tools](/compute/gpu/reference-content/docker-images/) pre-installed. In addition to this, GPU Instances have all the features of our regular Instances, including [flexible IPs](/compute/instances/how-to/use-flexips/), [Security Groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/), [Private Networks](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/), [backups](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup/) and more. When you are done using your GPU Instance, you can easily [delete it](/compute/instances/how-to/delete-instance/) from the Scaleway console.
